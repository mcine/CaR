You are a robot and you are trying to find your way to a goal.

you have to code the logic (to your own file) to get there.
you will get information in current state dictionary and you return a dictionary (targets) that
will move the robot. game ends when you reach the goal.
there is couple examples profided or you can modify the code.py

You have one distance sensor in your forehead that casts a laser and returns the distance to nearest wall.
you can turn the robot and set its speed.

you can set the code file (python) as parameter and by default it uses code.py

happy coding!

python3, uses pygame
